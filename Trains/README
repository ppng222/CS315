PURPOSE:
This tool is a program that simulates a switching station for trains.
It will start with a provided amount of trains, each with a provided amount of cars. The cars have a specific size to each.
The value of the train is the sum of the position of the cars multiplied by its size. 
Each simulation will toss three dice, one for the donor train and receiving train, and one for which end of the donor train the car will be taken from. 
The car is added to the receiving train the value of that train is recalculated.
The simulation ends either with an empty train or no more turns.
BUILD INFO:
Build this program using
'make comp'
INPUT:
The simulation takes a random number from an outside source. (in this case randGen.pl)
USAGE:
trains (NUMTRAINS) (NUMCARS) (NUMTURNS)
OUTPUT:
Console prints out the value of each train at each simulation.
